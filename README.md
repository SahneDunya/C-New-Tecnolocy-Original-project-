# C-New-Tecnolocy (Encyclopedia)
C New Technology is a programming language developed by Sahne Dünya based on the Classic C language but equipped with modern features. Sahne Dünya is to test the modern features of C/C++ fans. Another reason why Sahne Dünya created this programming language is to see more value in the software field, because C/C++ is used very often in operating systems, high-performance applications, low-level applications, and thanks to this programming language, they can quickly add it to their own projects and develop faster and add more modern features. Okay, although the community of languages ​​such as D and Rust is growing rapidly, the emergence of this programming language means that it will be head to head with a very big competitor! Sahne Dünya is actually one of the biggest fans of the C language, even though it uses Rust! The abbreviation of the name C New Technology is CNT. Your support is needed for the CNT language to achieve these goals!

# What is the difference between CNT language and classical C/C++?
1. Automatic memory management, C/C++ has manual memory management, C++ even though smart signs are released, memory is still managed manually, memory management in CNT language uses automatic memory management that follows the principle of ownership and borrowing!
2. Automatic Header system, the reason why C/C++ programming is harder than other modern languages ​​is that it needs a Header file, in CNT language, just like modern languages, there is no need for a Header file thanks to the automatic Header feature, thanks to this, they will be able to develop faster!
3. Automatic Library usage, in C/C++ language you need to manually #include commands to use the library, but in CNT language it uses the library automatically without #include commands, by default it uses Standard CNT Library, if you do not want to use it you need to use #not include <standard c libray> command, now it will use Embedded CNT Library, if you do not want to use any library you need to use extra #not include <embedded c libray> command. Without #not include <standard c libray> command #not include <embedded c libray> command is useless. None of these features are there in C and C++ and they have only standard libraries.
4. Standard Package Manager, as you know there is no standard package manager for C/C++ language, instead an external package manager is needed, But CNT language has a Standard Package Manager, thanks to this you do not need to install it externally!
5. Unsafe blocks, as you know there is no such concept as Unsafe blocks in C/C++ language because these languages ​​are unsafe by default, but there are these blocks in CNT language because CNT language offers stricter security than other C languages ​​and there is a command specific to this language called ''unsafe'' this command is useful for that!
